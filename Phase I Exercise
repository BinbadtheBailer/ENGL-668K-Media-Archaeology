There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
1984
•	What operating system does it run? 
CP/M or MS-DOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List).
Retail Price: The nearest I could find was the price of the Kaypro II, listed as both $1,795(1982)/$4,426.02(2015 
and $1,595(1982)/$3,932.87(2015).

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 
1983
•	What operating system does it run? 
Apple DOS 3.3, ProDOS (CHECK MANUAL)
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Retail price: $1,395(1983)/$3,332.66(2015). 
Secondhand: Fairly easy to find on secondhand market (both on eBay and Craigslist). $200-$764.15 (based on condition, box and manuals, etc.)
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 
1987
•	What operating system does it run? 
3.3-3.4, 4.0–6.0.2, 6.0.3–6.0.8, 7.0-7.5.5 (CHECK MANUAL)
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List).

Secondhand: Ranged from $25-$1,300 (both Craigslist and eBay)
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 
1982
•	What operating system does it run? 
I could not find any information on its operating system.
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Retail Price: $199(1982)/$490.68(2015). 
Secondhand: Not too hard to find on eBay. $25-$1300
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
Presumably, the simplicity of using vectors made it easier to program the games. Of course, that seemed to limit the game types 
to variations on Asteroids. The Star Trek was just a first-person version of Asteroids, and one of the other games I tried
just had the player's avatar at the bottom of the field shooting objects moving around from up top, bouncing the projectile 
off of surfaces.
===================================================================================================================
AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 
1985
•	What operating system does it run? 
AmigaOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
The Amiga1000 retailed at $1,295(1985)/$2,863.74(2015). 
Secondhand: I was able to find a few on eBay. $90-$5,900 (couldn't tell what was special about the high-end one).
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
According to The Future Was Here, the Amiga was the happy medium between game machines (like the Atari) and boring business 
machines (IBM).
It had a large color palette, and its capacity to store and display color photos, manipulate video and real world sounds 
paved the way for modern creative work being done digitally on computers.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
There are standard programs such as a notepad and a paint function. Looking at some of the diskettes, there looked to be some 
enterprise software. I tried one labeled Marauder 2, as I thought it was a game, but I couldn't get it to work. There was a 
demo of Arkanoid on the diskette, but I couldn't seem to play it.

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made?
1989

•	What operating system does it run? 
System 7.5-Mac OS 7.0.1

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Price: $6,269 (1989)/$12,029.65(2015). 
Secondhand: Not too hard to find on eBay. From $39.99-$379.99 (high end includes peripherals).

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
While both were, for the most part, fairly intuitive (or at least similar to modern iterations of word processsing programs, 
I preferred using WordPerfect. I could not figure out how to fix the margins, as it seemed set to split the page in half. I 
found the margin settings in Page Setup, but the default margins were set correctly, so I wasn't sure what to do.
As for other what else was on this Mac, there was Excel and an anti-virus program. The documents suggested that past user was 
an employee in the print media services department in Hornbake Library.
