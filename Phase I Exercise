There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
1984
•	What operating system does it run? 
CP/M or MS-DOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List).
Retail Price: The nearest I could find was the price of the Kaypro II, listed as both $1,795(1982)/$4,426.02(2015 
and $1,595(1982)/$3,932.87(2015).
Secondhand: Hard to find. Found one on ebay for $299 (buy it now).

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Kaypro was designed to be transportable (if not quite portable) like one of its competitors, the Osborne 1. It also had a
reputation for being durable and easy to use, and its bundling with software made it quite economical. It eventually
beat out its competitor for a few reasons: larger screen, relatively inexpensive ("the $1595 computer that sells for $1595"),
simple closed architecture for non-hobbyist consumers (no need to buy parts and install them), bundled third-party software
(e.g. Wordstar), and support from a network of trained dealers. Its eventual failure seems to have been caused by the slow 
uptake of MS-DOS, which allowed competitors to gain a larger share of the market. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)
It turns out that all of life's questions can be answered by Google. In this particular case, it was all thanks to a guy on
Youtube who recorded the screen of his Kaypro as he loaded up WordStar. I was putting in every disk, looking for some sort of
Master disk. It's hard to imagine lay consumers being able to use something like this today. It's hard to say how much can be
attributed to modern practices of UI design making access easier for more people or a general devaluation in computer literacy
(essentially the age-old flamewar between Macs and PCs).
===================================================================================================================
APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 
1983
•	What operating system does it run? 
Apple DOS 3.3
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Retail price: $1,395(1983)/$3,332.66(2015). 
Secondhand: Fairly easy to find on secondhand market (both on eBay and Craigslist). $200-$764.15 (based on condition, box and manuals, etc.)

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
An enhanced edition of the Apple II series, the IIe included many features that had to be added on to earlier models. It was 
appreciated by many first-time computer buyers for its various features and improvements. Considered a "workhorse" model, it 
is known for being the longest-lived computer in Apple history. Its 11 years on the market (with few changes) seems unthinkable
in an era of planned obsolescence (and perhaps Moore's Law). Some of the notable features are a full ASCII character set and 
keyboard as well as backwards compatability with the vast majority of Apple II software.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
I appreciated the sense of humor shown in the tutorial software. I wonder if the humor is more reflective of computers tending
to be associated more with hobbyists than general users. I plan on giving Seadragon another try, but I wonder if there 
might be something wrong with the controller. Unless you are given a limited number of shots (not the screen-nuking bombs), 
which a Youtube seems to suggest isn't the case, the "Fire" button doesn't seem to be working quite right.

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 
1987
•	What operating system does it run? 
System Software 7.0.1
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Retail Price: Dual Floppy: $2900(1987)/$6,074.30(2015). With 20 MB hard drive: $3900(1987)/$8,168.89(2015)
Secondhand: Ranged from $25-$1,300 (both Craigslist and eBay)

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The SE had some marginal improvements over its predecessor, the Macintosh Plus: the Apple Desktop Bus, replacing the older 
port and connector for the keyboard and mouse, respectively; a port for expanded features (SE stood for "System Expansion");
and a cooling fan for the longevity of the hardware. One of the SE's most notable features was that it was the first 
Macintosh to allow for an internal hard drive (or a second floppy drive).

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?

WE DESCEND
At first it looked like it was some kind of electronic novel with pictures. However, after going through a few 
pages, I started getting blanks. I found my way to a group of boxes (Foreword, Inventory, Directions, Front Matter, Back Matter) 
with what look like links, but opening up the boxes always seems to lead to blank pages.

MOON TO DEENA
The opening screen shows the same kinds of boxes that look like they might be linked. Clicking on them brings up black and 
white pictures that are a bit hard to see clearly. I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding what these are supposed to be, but it
looks like the software isn't rendering the pages/images correctly.

STORYSPACE 1.5
This is hypertext writing software used to make the other electronic novels on the dekstop.

One thing that surprised me about the electronic novels was practices I would better associate with modern computing and the
Internet. The use of links in We Descend was quite unexpected, and same goes for the linking of different pages on the map of 
the town. After going through the article on Updike's process and trying out the hypertext novels, I marveled at how people
managed to use this kind of antiquated software. Of course, many of the everyday functions of a computer that I think of as
intuitive were likely learned from a young age and are really no more "natural" than anything users in the 80s would have to
go through. I do wonder if there is something about touch interfaces that make them so intuitive (even for young children).

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 
1982
•	What operating system does it run? 
I could not find any information on its operating system.
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Retail Price: $199(1982)/$490.68(2015). 
Secondhand: Not too hard to find on eBay. $25-$1300

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
Some of the Vectrex's distinguishing features are its use of vector graphics (paths) instead of raster graphics (pixels) and 
its integrated monitor. Though it had the misfortune of being released soon before a major recession in the video game
industry, it received praise for its durability, controller design, and library of games. The Vectrex also had a notably 
function design, with a storage area at the bottom of the console for the control panel.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
Presumably, the simplicity of using vectors made it easier to program the games. In relation to raster graphics, the vector
graphics allow for the possibility of increasing the scale of the graphics without losing fidelity. Of course, the types of 
games look to mostly be limited to variations on Asteroids. The Star Trek game was just a first-person version of Asteroids, 
and one of the other games I tried just had the player's avatar at the bottom of the field shooting objects moving around from 
up top, bouncing the projectile off of surfaces.

While this is certainly not particular to the Vectrex, the use of cartridges for storing game data is an obvious point of
differentiation from modern gaming. "Loading" was not a phrase I spent much time seeing on my old NES and SNES, and the Vectrex
certainly doesn't have to suffer anything like that. It's hard to say whether an integrated monitor is preferable, but in
some ways it seems much simpler than modern gaming systems. Of course, nothing was so bad as having to lug around an old
CRT tv back in the days before LCD tv sets.

AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 
1985
•	What operating system does it run? 
AmigaOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Retail Price: The Amiga1000 retailed at $1,295(1985)/$2,863.74(2015). 
Secondhand: I was able to find a few on eBay. $90-$5,900 (couldn't tell what was special about the high-end one).

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
According to THE FUTURE WAS HERE, the Amiga was the happy medium between game machines (like the Atari) and boring business 
machines (IBM). While it was marketed as an all-purpose business machine, it had more popularity among general consumers as 
home computers, particularly due to its numerous games and creative software. Before Apple became the standard for those doing
creative work, the Amiga was highly regarded as a useful computer for music and video production. It had a large color palette, and its capacity to store and display color photos, manipulate video and real world sounds 
paved the way for modern creative work being done digitally on computers. One strength of the operating system was its use of
both a command-line interface and a GUI. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
There are standard programs such as a notepad and a paint function. Looking at some of the diskettes, there looked to be some 
enterprise software. I tried one labeled Marauder 2, as I thought it was a game, but I couldn't get it to work. There was a 
demo of Arkanoid on the diskette, but I couldn't seem to play it.

===================================================================================================================
MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made?
1989

•	What operating system does it run? 
System 7.5-Mac OS 7.0.1

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Price: $6,269 (1989)/$12,029.65(2015). 
Secondhand: Not too hard to find on eBay. From $39.99-$379.99 (high end includes peripherals).

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
Some of the notable features of the IIci are its built-in monitor support, Level 2 caching for faster data retrieval, and 
built-in color video circuitry. Its memory management system (32-bit clean ROM) was new, but it became a weakness due to 
issues regarding memory protection, which led to crashes and related system problems. The IIci was known for having a long 
life, and was generally used for business purposes.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
While both were, for the most part, fairly intuitive (or at least similar to modern iterations of word processsing programs, 
I preferred using WordPerfect. I could not figure out how to fix the margins, as it seemed set to split the page in half. I 
found the margin settings in Page Setup, but the default margins were set correctly, so I wasn't sure what to do.
As for other what else was on this Mac, there was Excel and an anti-virus program. The documents suggested that past user was 
an employee in the print media services department in Hornbake Library.

The thing that surprised me most about the IIci was the speed with which it brought up the desktop. I don't think we could get
there quite as fast until we started booting off of SSDs.
